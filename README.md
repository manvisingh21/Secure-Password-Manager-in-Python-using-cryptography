# Secure-Password-Manager-in-Python-using-cryptography
Description: This Python project implements a secure password manager that employs strong encryption techniques for password storage and retrieval. The program uses the `cryptography` library for cryptographic functions and `hashlib` for password hashing. Users can save, retrieve, export, and import passwords with an added layer of security through a master password. The project includes features such as password strength checking and data encryption, providing a robust solution for managing sensitive account information. The implementation emphasizes security practices to protect user credentials effectively.
